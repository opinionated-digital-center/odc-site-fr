# Opinionated Digital Center's website

Opinionated Digital Center is "opinionated" in the sense that is it reflects strong structural and tooling choices, which ODC members believe help developers - and development - being more effective within the context of digital centers. (Even though we believe large portions also help being more effective in any development project)

The website is a static website built with [![Jekyll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jekyll/jekyll/master/docs/img/logo-rss.png)](https://jekyllrb.com/).
